# global warming simulation

This project uses https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl
([docs](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeatherDocumentation/dev/))
to illustrate how global warming changes the planet's climate.

It addresses the classic issue people raise that goes something like:

> If the planet is warming,
> how come it's so cold outside right now?

The classic response to that is to dismiss it with something like
"weather is not climate" but that's an unsatisfying answer.
I think it's better to show what's going on on a model.
